# StructureReplicator
A command-line utility that reads a baseline text file (formatted as a tree output) and replicates the specified folder and file hierarchy in a target location. StructureReplicator offers an option to create only the directory structure or both folders and empty files, making it perfect for mirroring predefined file systems.
